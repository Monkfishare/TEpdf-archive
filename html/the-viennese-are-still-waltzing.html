In later years the pope’s dictum became <i>Die</i> <i>Insel der Seligen</i>, the island of the blessed, to describe the picturesque Alpine republic that is garlanded with a generous welfare state, the Habsburg empire’s rich cultural heritage, <i>Kaiserschmarrn </i>and other scrumptious foods, and some of the finest classical music in the world.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The inexorable rise of Austria’s far-right Freedom Party which, the polls say, is now the country’s strongest party by a long chalk, suggests that a sizeable chunk of Austrians fear that their way of life, prosperity and safety are under threat. Yet Austrians remain the most smugly satisfied with life in the European Union (<small>eu</small>), whereas their big German neighbours are the second-saddest, according to a newly published survey by Eurostat, the <small>EU</small>’s statistics agency. Austrians rated their satisfaction with life in 2022 on average at 7.9 on a scale of one to ten, compared with just 6.5 for their big German neighbours and 5.6 for Bulgarians, the gloomiest of the lot. Poles, Romanians and Finns, with a score of 7.7, are joint second-jolliest after Austria.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Austrians and Germans face the same big challenges, including the cost-of-living crisis, an ageing population, illegal immigration and increasing social polarisation. Yet Austria is doing better on several counts that lift the national mood. Its national railways are efficient and affordable compared with the overcrowded, chronically unpunctual disaster that is Deutsche Bahn. Big chunks of Austria’s public administration, including its health service, have been digitised, while Germany is far behind. Austria’s economy is forecast to grow this year, whereas Germany’s is forecast to remain in recession. And in November Austria beat Germany at football.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Vienna is a symbol of the country’s post-war rebirth as a prosperous, welcoming place, whereas Berlin is edgier and dirtier than the rest of Germany. In an annual index by the Economist Intelligence Unit, a sister company of <i>The Economist</i>, Vienna retained its crown in 2023 as the world’s most liveable city. Ranking 173 of them in a range of categories, including health care, culture, environment, education and infrastructure, the index gave Vienna nearly full marks, with 98.4 out of 100.  No German city made the top ten. Berlin shared 17th place with Frankfurt. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/cafe-europa">Café Europa</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div></section></body>
