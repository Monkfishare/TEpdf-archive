Flawless Dionysus, the Greek god of <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2017/11/16/wine-making-existed-at-least-500-years-earlier-than-previously-known">wine</a> and general good-time chap (his nude marble body setting unrealistic beauty standards long before the invention of Instagram) stands next to a tall banner of Bodhisattva Maitreya, the future Buddha, his gaze serene, features sharp, body supple: a perfect man.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Across the rotunda is a diptych of vengeful leonine goddesses: there, in three-millennia-old mottled rock, is Sekhmet, the fierce lion-headed Egyptian goddess, eye of Ra, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/07/28/the-sun-is-both-our-creator-and-destroyer">sun</a> god, and destroyer of his enemies. Hanging beside her is the lion-headed Narasimhi, ferocious consort of Vishnu, the Hindu god of preservation.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There are many similarities between the masterpieces on display at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (<small>CSMVS</small>) museum in Mumbai, as well as important differences. Why, some onlookers have wondered, do Dionysus and other European gods look away from the worshipper when Indian deities stare directly at onlookers? And why are they all naked? Should Western gods not be draped in jewels and gold and the finest fabrics, like India’s? How, visitors have asked the curators, can you even tell that this nude body over here is a god at all?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>CSMVS</small> has mounted “Ancient Sculptures: India, Egypt, Assyria, Greece, Rome” to draw attention to the echoes between great ancient civilisations—and to give rise to new ways of looking at them. The exhibition, <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/a-mumbai-museum-has-a-different-way-of-looking-at-history">which is a collaboration</a> with the British Museum in London, Berlin State Museums and Getty Museum in Los Angeles (all of which provided works on long-term loan), will run until October.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The objective of the exhibition is two-fold. The first is to bring to an Indian audience, and especially students, great works of antiquity from European museums that are otherwise inaccessible to the vast majority of locals due to borders, labyrinthine visa processes and pricey plane tickets. The second is to foster acceptance and respect for other cultures by emphasising the rich connections and cultural exchange that have existed since ancient times, says Sabyasachi Mukherjee, the director of <small>CSMVS.</small></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This is something that is even more noteworthy in an era of increasing fragmentation or “slowbalisation”. A Greek poem from the fifth century <small>BC</small> imagined Dionysus conquering India—a textual attempt to integrate the subcontinent with the Mediterranean world, perhaps. The sculpture of Buddha from the second century <small>BC</small>, crafted in what is now Pakistan, is probably a product of artistic influences shaped by the invasion of India by <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/01/05/alexander-the-great-and-the-birth-of-the-modern-world">Alexander the Great</a> two centuries earlier.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">An unstated undercurrent of the exhibition is the unforgiving <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/03/02/narendra-modi-and-the-struggle-for-indias-soul">Hindu nationalism</a> of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which has spread to the country’s cultural institutions. The party’s propagandists are busy painting India as a “world teacher”, with historical achievements that range from being the “mother of democracy” to inventing nuclear weapons in antiquity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">A regrettable, if integral, part of pumping up Hindu pride has been the degrading of all foreign cultures as inferior. An exhibition that reminds Indians that they are a part of the global community, in which India both influenced and was influenced by other cultures, is a powerful counter.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The museum in Mumbai, rare among Indian institutions for being autonomous and non-state-funded, and therefore less likely to produce propaganda, is ideally positioned to mount such a project. It is the first choice for collaborations in India, according to Western curators.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">This is a chance to look afresh at much-analysed objects, too. The study of antiquity has long been dominated by Europeans and Americans, seen from the perspective of Greece and Rome—with India as an afterthought. But “if you start from the Indian end” it changes the way you might see Western sculpture, says Neil MacGregor, a former director of the British Museum who advised on the project. Many of the visitors’ questions, including why ancient Greek and Roman gods were portrayed as naked, were so novel that they left the organisers flummoxed. According to Mr MacGregor, “A lot of the curators in London and Berlin weren’t able to quickly answer [them]—or at all.”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">In gods we trust</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The organisers also hope the global co-curation effort will provide a new model for the sharing of art across borders. <small>CSMVS</small> plans to follow up the exhibition with a second, more ambitious project: an “Ancient World Gallery” with more than 100 objects from around the world, opening in 2025 and running for three years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">For all the talk of novelty—new connections between sculptures and juxtapositions—there is one way in which the exhibition is a return to older traditions. As the West secularised, ancient gods transitioned from deities to artefacts: they became towering achievements of art, symbols of power and prosperity, but no longer figures of devotion. However, bring those objects to India and put them alongside gods still actively worshipped by a billion people—it is not uncommon for visitors to <small>CSMVS</small>’s galleries to remove their footwear before sculptures of Hindu gods, or to touch their feet in ritual devotion—and suddenly Dionysus and Sekhmet and other gods of various pantheons are imbued with renewed spiritual power. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><i>For more on the latest books, films, <small>TV </small>shows, albums and controversies, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/introducing-plot-twist-our-new-culture-newsletter" target="_blank">Plot Twist</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter</i></p></div></section></body>
