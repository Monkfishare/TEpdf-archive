The circumstances were murky, but Russia said the plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were heading for a prisoner exchange with Russian <small>POW</small>s, as well as nine crew. Ukraine said it had not been asked to ensure a safe passage for the aircraft. A few days earlier, Russia blamed Ukrainian forces for a strike on <b>Donetsk</b>, a city under Russian occupation in eastern Ukraine, in which 28 people were killed (a Ukrainian army group in the area said it had not been involved). Two days after that at least 18 people were killed in Russian strikes on other Ukrainian cities.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>NATO</small> approved a $1.2bn contract that will replenish the artillery-shell stocks of the alliance’s members, allowing them to provide more ammunition to Ukraine.

Republicans in the House of Representatives are refusing to back the bill until they get a deal on stricter immigration policies, though a compromise in the Senate is emerging.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><b>Turkey’s</b> parliament at last approved<b> Sweden’s</b> bid to join <small><b>NATO</b>.</small> Turkey, which as a <small>NATO</small> member must bless another country’s accession, had dragged its heels over the bid, claiming that Sweden harboured Kurdish militants.
