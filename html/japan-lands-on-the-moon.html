At 00:20 Japan time, Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (<small>slim</small>), a<small> </small>spacecraft owned by <small>JAXA</small>, the Japanese space agency, made its first Moon landing. Japan is the fifth country—following the <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/23/indias-lunar-triumph">landing in August</a> by India’s Chandrayaan-3—to have achieved that feat.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Enthusiasm at <small>JAXA </small>was somewhat tempered. Owing to problems with its solar panels, the spacecraft soon lost its ability to generate electricity. <small>JAXA </small>officials duly announced that they had shut down the space probe’s power after its battery level dropped to 12%. Even so, the landing showed the strength of Japan’s space programme, which has long made scientific contributions through specialisms such as robotics. The lunar landing also underlines the strategic role of Japan, an ally of America, in the new space race.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>SLIM,</small> also known as Moon Sniper, could transform space exploration. Whereas conventional landers touch down within a range of tens of kilometres, <small>SLIM</small> can land within 100 metres of a target. Such advances are in demand, because decades after the Apollo landings, countries are tilting at the Moon again.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Exploring its south pole is especially important. That region is likely to contain water ice, from which fuel and oxygen could be produced in order to propel further space explorations. To study the Moon’s resources, precision-landing technology will be necessary, says Sakai Shinichiro, <small>SLIM’</small>s project manager at<small> JAXA.</small></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Rivalry between America and China is one reason for the renewed interest in space. Under its Artemis programme, America plans to send astronauts to the lunar south pole by 2026, and eventually build a habitable base there.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>JAXA</small> is building part of a lunar-orbiting station for Artemis, known as Gateway, which is intended to be a transit point to the Moon and Mars. China also aims to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, and to build a lunar base. Bill Nelson, <small>NASA’</small>s chief, has warned that China might try to dominate the Moon’s resources, perhaps turning the lunar south pole into “another South China Sea”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Given such geopolitical pressures, Japan’s long-standing programme has become more associated with defence. A law adopted in 1969 limited the country to using space only for peaceful purposes. That constraint was eased in 2008 with the passage of the Basic Space Law. In June 2023 the government established its first space-security policy, a ten-year road map for expanding information-gathering for missile defence and securing a safe environment for satellites.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Japan’s strengths are better suited to non-military ventures, however. Last year the government said it would establish a ¥1trn ($6.8bn) space fund. That is modest compared with spending by America and China. Still, Japan has made decent contributions by “carving out niche strengths”, including unmanned missions, says Tokaji Ayumu, a former <small>JAXA </small>engineer. In 2010 Japan’s <i>Hayabusa</i> spacecraft became the first to take samples from an asteroid and bring them to Earth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The <small>SLIM</small> project draws on <small>JAXA’</small>s previous lunar-orbiting mission, by the spacecraft <i>Kaguya</i>. It created “the most detailed” topographical model of the Moon to date, according to <small>NASA.</small> <small>SLIM</small> uses machine-learning to analyse high-resolution maps of the Moon’s craters produced by <i>Kaguya</i>, to identify potential landing-spots. <small>JAXA</small> decided to send<small> SLIM </small>to the Shioli crater on the near side of the Moon, because rocks in the area might contain minerals from the Moon’s mantle. Studying them could help explain the Moon’s origins.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Despite the power-generation problems,<small> SLIM</small> successfully deployed two rovers, which managed to take a picture from the Moon and send it back to Earth. After an initial investigation, <small>JAXA</small>’s engineers have concluded that the spacecraft was not crippled, but has tilted westwards, away from the Sun. That holds open a possibility that the craft could yet start generating power. The engineers say they are now “preparing for recovery”. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div></section></body>
