No one needs a head of diversity to tell them that.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Tim Hill<br/></small><i>Singapore</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As a psychologist and chief human-resources officer I struggled with <small>DEI</small> for decades. My concerns are not about the need, but about the methods. Much of what is being done in the name of <small>DEI</small> oversimplifies the problem of bias and lacks a fundamental understanding of human behaviour. This has led to unrealistic expectations about what it should or can accomplish.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Bias is hardwired into the human brain. Evolution has made us prefer what is similar, known and familiar (in other words safe) and to be cautious about what is different (or perhaps unsafe). Our bias for the familiar extends beyond people. Our brains automatically and unconsciously pull our attention towards perspectives, ideas, data, music, food, literature, and so on, that are similar and familiar, and away from the very same things when they are different and unfamiliar.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">As practised today, <small>DEI</small> promotes a mistaken belief that setting noble expectations, creating awareness, making conscious behavioural decisions and rebuking those who don’t change can flip a switch to produce unbiased brains. <small>DEI</small> thinks bias is a matter of will, which runs counter to the past 50 years of social-science research. If changing our behaviour were that easy, people would exercise regularly, never experience marital conflict, retire with robust pensions and still be reading the only diet book ever published.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">There are real issues to be addressed: companies do need more diversity of perspective and underrepresented groups do need more opportunities. But organisations must rethink their methods by drawing more on social science and less on social activism. No amount of social idealism will rewire millions of years of neural evolution.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Scott Simmons<br/></small><i>Denver</i></p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20240113_LDD001.jpg" srcset="../image/20240113_LDD001.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Justin Metz</span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">It’s not just about the car</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">The idea that the West should welcome a huge influx of Chinese electric vehicles is mind boggling (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/01/11/an-influx-of-chinese-cars-is-terrifying-the-west" target="_blank">China’s <small>EV</small> onslaught</a>”, January 13th). The opening of trade with China in the late 1980s was justified by the expectation that an emerging Chinese middle class would demand democracy and throw off the shackles of the Communist Party. Instead, Chinese affluence driven by Western investment and consumption has facilitated the Chinese government’s efforts to centralise power, acquire the West’s technologies, build more military capabilities, ruthlessly repress any opposition and build alliances with dictatorships. Far from becoming more democratic and open, China’s leadership now represents one of the most severe long-term threats to world security, if not the future of Western civilisation.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Your argument seems to be that we should increase our trade with China, which would thereby encourage, if not accelerate, these dangerous trends.

We talk of markets, innovation, and capitalism, and yet when someone shows us up, we cringe and make excuses, or as in the case of Japan’s economic might in the 1980s, adopt policies to make the other fail. It is time for the West to realise that we are not in our ascendancy, but rather in a state of stagnation or decline in several spheres.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph"><small>Seve Ghose<br/></small><i>San Francisco</i></p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="US President Biden on a landline phone waving to a puzzled group all looking at mobile phones" data-nimg="1" decoding="async" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" src="../image/20231223_USD000.jpg" srcset="../image/20231223_USD000.jpg" style="color:transparent" width="1280"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: KAL</span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e1s7vz8e0">Hats off</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0" data-component="paragraph">Lexington repeated the common assertion that John Kennedy did not wear a hat during his inauguration (<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/20/why-donald-trump-is-gaining-ground-with-young-voters" target="_blank">December 23rd</a>).

As well as mainland Europe, one such stone is in London, dedicated to Ada van Dantzig, a Dutch restorer of paintings. She had returned to her family in Rotterdam after the outbreak of the war in 1939, was arrested in France in May 1943 and then murdered at Auschwitz. Her stone was laid in May 2022, and can be found at Golden Square, Soho.

Somewhere in Egg Harbor, New Jersey, is the home of Morton Goldstein, a soldier who was captured at the Battle of the Bulge and murdered at Berga in March 1945.
